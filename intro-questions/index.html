    <h1>Introductory Questions</h1>
        <ol>
            <li>I'm Baaj and I'm a senior studying computer science and finance</li>
            <li>I enjoy software devleopment, especially frontend, and I'm an HCI minor. Sometimes other courses can move very quickly so I wanted to go back and make sure I had  a firm understanding of html and css.</li>
            <li>Yes, I've taken mulitple course as well as internships that use these languages, but again, I  would like to make sure I understand the foundation of these langauges</li>
            <li>I hope to learn the specific ways you can manipulate a page with CSS</li>
            <li>Desinging for a screen is a bit less tangible in that you can't as easily edit a screen the same way you could paper</li>
            <li><a href=https://www.netflix.com/browse>Netflix</a> has an effective design with a useful nav bar, large banner image, a list of items below, and a hover feature to get more info on specific items</li>
            <li><a href=https://wustl.instructure.com>Canvas</a> has an effective home page that communicates all the neccesary info. You have all the enrolled courses and a to-do list + coming-up list on the right which communicates all assignment info.</li>
            <li><a href=https://www.gradescope.com>Gradescope</a> works well as it only ever gives you the information you need to access at the moment in a clean and easy to read manner.</li>
        </ol>
